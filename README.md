If you write a blog post or article about this data, please let me know.

My [blog post](https://shape-of-code.com/2019/12/15/the-renzo-pomodoro-dataset/) picking out a few interesting points about the data.

If you have recorded personal task estimates (or any interesting software engineering data), I offer to do a free data analysis, provided you are willing to make the data publicly available in anonymized form.
